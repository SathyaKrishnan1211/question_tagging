"Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the development process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing so much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0.Kolya remembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n and that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars (for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each).Kolya is now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins buying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game. Formally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a × 1 234 567 + b × 123 456 + c × 1 234 = n?Please help Kolya answer this question. Input: ['1359257'] Output:['YES']",0
"The last contest held on Johnny's favorite competitive programming platform has been received rather positively. However, Johnny's rating has dropped again! He thinks that the presented tasks are lovely, but don't show the truth about competitors' skills.The boy is now looking at the ratings of consecutive participants written in a binary system. He thinks that the more such ratings differ, the more unfair is that such people are next to each other. He defines the difference between two numbers as the number of bit positions, where one number has zero, and another has one (we suppose that numbers are padded with leading zeros to the same length). For example, the difference of 5 = 101_2 and 14 = 1110_2 equals to 3, since 0101 and 1110 differ in 3 positions. Johnny defines the unfairness of the contest as the sum of such differences counted for neighboring participants.Johnny has just sent you the rating sequence and wants you to find the unfairness of the competition. You have noticed that you've got a sequence of consecutive integers from 0 to n. That's strange, but the boy stubbornly says that everything is right. So help him and find the desired unfairness for received numbers. Input: ['5', '5', '7', '11', '1', '2000000000000', ''] Output:['8', '11', '19', '1', '3999999999987', '']",2
"There is a rectangular grid of size n * m. Each cell has a number written on it; the number on the cell (i, j) is a_{i, j}. Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (n, m) meeting the following constraints:  You can move to the right or to the bottom only. Formally, from the cell (i, j) you may move to the cell (i, j + 1) or to the cell (i + 1, j). The target cell can't be outside of the grid.  The xor of all the numbers on the path from the cell (1, 1) to the cell (n, m) must be equal to k (xor operation is the bitwise exclusive OR, it is represented as '^' in Java or C++ and ""xor"" in Pascal). Find the number of such paths in the given grid. Input: ['3 3 112 1 57 10 012 6 4'] Output:['3']",0
"Chouti thought about his very first days in competitive programming. When he had just learned to write merge sort, he thought that the merge sort is too slow, so he restricted the maximum depth of recursion and modified the merge sort to the following:  Chouti found his idea dumb since obviously, this ""merge sort"" sometimes cannot sort the array correctly. However, Chouti is now starting to think of how good this ""merge sort"" is. Particularly, Chouti wants to know for a random permutation a of 1, 2, ..., n the expected number of inversions after calling MergeSort(a, 1, n, k).It can be proved that the expected number is rational. For the given prime q, suppose the answer can be denoted by \frac{u}{d} where gcd(u,d)=1, you need to output an integer r satisfying 0 <= r<q and rd \equiv u \pmod q. It can be proved that such r exists and is unique. Input: ['3 1 998244353'] Output:['499122178']",3
"You are playing a computer game. To pass the current level, you have to kill a big horde of monsters. In this horde, there are n monsters standing in the row, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th monster has a_i health and a special ""Death's Blessing"" spell of strength b_i attached to it.You are going to kill all of them one by one. It takes exactly h seconds to kill a monster with health h.When the i-th monster dies, it casts its spell that increases the health of its neighbors by b_i (the neighbors of the j-th monster in the row are the monsters on places j - 1 and j + 1. The first and the last monsters have only one neighbor each).After each monster is killed, the row shrinks, so its former neighbors become adjacent to each other (so if one of them dies, the other one is affected by its spell). For example, imagine a situation with 4 monsters with health a = [2, 6, 7, 3] and spells b = [3, 6, 0, 5]. One of the ways to get rid of the monsters is shown below:  2673\xrightarrow{6\ s}8133\xrightarrow{13\ s}83\xrightarrow{8\ s}6\xrightarrow{6\ s}\{\}3605305355 The first row represents the health of each monster, the second one — the power of the spells. As a result, we can kill all monsters in 6 + 13 + 8 + 6 = 33 seconds. Note that it's only an example and may not be the fastest way to get rid of the monsters.What is the minimum time required to kill all monsters in the row?

"You are given an integer n. In 1 move, you can do one of the following actions:  erase any digit of the number (it's acceptable that the number before the operation has exactly one digit and after the operation, it is ""empty"");  add one digit to the right. The actions may be performed in any order any number of times.Note that if, after deleting some digit from a number, it will contain leading zeroes, they will not be deleted. E.g. if you delete from the number 301 the digit 3, the result is the number 01 (not 1).You need to perform the minimum number of actions to make the number any power of 2 (i.e. there's an integer k (k >= 0) such that the resulting number is equal to 2^k). The resulting number must not have leading zeroes.E.g. consider n=1052. The answer is equal to 2. First, let's add to the right one digit 4 (the result will be 10524). Then let's erase the digit 5, so the result will be 1024 which is a power of 2.E.g. consider n=8888. The answer is equal to 3. Let's erase any of the digits 8 three times.

"Monocarp is playing a strategy game. In the game, he recruits a squad to fight monsters. Before each battle, Monocarp has C coins to spend on his squad.Before each battle starts, his squad is empty. Monocarp chooses one type of units and recruits no more units of that type than he can recruit with C coins.There are n types of units. Every unit type has three parameters:   c_i — the cost of recruiting one unit of the i-th type;  d_i — the damage that one unit of the i-th type deals in a second;  h_i — the amount of health of one unit of the i-th type. Monocarp has to face m monsters. Every monster has two parameters:   D_j — the damage that the j-th monster deals in a second;  H_j — the amount of health the j-th monster has. Monocarp has to fight only the j-th monster during the j-th battle. He wants all his recruited units to stay alive. Both Monocarp's squad and the monster attack continuously (not once per second) and at the same time. Thus, Monocarp wins the battle if and only if his squad kills the monster strictly faster than the monster kills one of his units. The time is compared with no rounding.For each monster, Monocarp wants to know the minimum amount of coins he has to spend to kill that monster. If this amount is greater than C, then report that it's impossible to kill that monster. Input: ['3 10', '3 4 6', '5 5 5', '10 3 4', '3', '8 3', '5 4', '10 15', ''] Output:['5 3 -1 ', '']",0

Once upon a time, the ruler of the ancient Egypt ordered the workers of Hanoi Factory to create as high tower as possible. They were not ready to serve such a strange order so they had to create this new tower using already produced rings.There are n rings in factory's stock. The i-th ring has inner radius ai, outer radius bi and height hi. The goal is to select some subset of rings and arrange them such that the following conditions are satisfied:  Outer radiuses form a non-increasing sequence, i.e. one can put the j-th ring on the i-th ring only if bj ≤ bi.  Rings should not fall one into the the other. That means one can place ring j on the ring i only if bj > ai.  The total height of all rings used should be maximum possible.

"Don't you tell me what you think that I can beIf you say that Arkady is a bit old-fashioned playing checkers, you won't be right. There is also a modern computer game Arkady and his friends are keen on. We won't discuss its rules, the only feature important to this problem is that each player has to pick a distinct hero in the beginning of the game.There are 2 teams each having n players and 2n heroes to distribute between the teams. The teams take turns picking heroes: at first, the first team chooses a hero in its team, after that the second team chooses a hero and so on. Note that after a hero is chosen it becomes unavailable to both teams.The friends estimate the power of the i-th of the heroes as p_i. Each team wants to maximize the total power of its heroes. However, there is one exception: there are m pairs of heroes that are especially strong against each other, so when any team chooses a hero from such a pair, the other team must choose the other one on its turn. Each hero is in at most one such pair.This is an interactive problem. You are to write a program that will optimally choose the heroes for one team, while the jury's program will play for the other team. Note that the jury's program may behave inefficiently, in this case you have to take the opportunity and still maximize the total power of your team.

But in fact, some steps are resulting from walking backwards!There are some possible order of steps that produce these footprints such as 1 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 4 or 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 1 (we suppose that the distance between two consecutive steps can be arbitrarily long). The number of backward steps from above two examples are 2 and 1 separately.Alice is interested in these footprints. Whenever there is a person walking trough the trail, she takes a picture of all these footprints along the trail and erase all of them so that next person will leave a new set of footprints. We know that people walk by alternating right foot and left foot, but we don't know if the first step is made by left foot or right foot.Alice wants to know the minimum possible number of backward steps made by a person. But it's a little hard. Please help Alice to calculate it. You also need to construct one possible history of these footprints. Input: ['RRLRL'] Output:['12 5 1 3 4']",2
"Friends are going to play console. They have two joysticks and only one charger for them. Initially first joystick is charged at a1 percent and second one is charged at a2 percent. You can connect charger to a joystick only at the beginning of each minute. In one minute joystick either discharges by 2 percent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1 percent (if connected to a charger).Game continues while both joysticks have a positive charge. Hence, if at the beginning of minute some joystick is charged by 1 percent, it has to be connected to a charger, otherwise the game stops. If some joystick completely discharges (its charge turns to 0), the game also stops.Determine the maximum number of minutes that game can last.

"Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from 1 to 9). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, ..., 9m, 1p, 2p, ..., 9p, 1s, 2s, ..., 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu.

"Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again.The device is powered by two wires ""plus"" and ""minus"". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view):  Mike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the ""plus"" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture).

"Efim just received his grade for the last test. He studies in a special school and his grade can be equal to any positive decimal fraction. First he got disappointed, as he expected a way more pleasant result. Then, he developed a tricky plan. Each second, he can ask his teacher to round the grade at any place after the decimal point (also, he can ask to round to the nearest integer). There are t seconds left till the end of the break, so Efim has to act fast. Help him find what is the maximum grade he can get in no more than t seconds. Note, that he can choose to not use all t seconds. Moreover, he can even choose to not round the grade at all.In this problem, classic rounding rules are used: while rounding number to the n-th digit one has to take a look at the digit n + 1. If it is less than 5 than the n-th digit remain unchanged while all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. Otherwise, if the n + 1 digit is greater or equal to 5, the digit at the position n is increased by 1 (this might also change some other digits, if this one was equal to 9) and all subsequent digits are replaced with 0. At the end, all trailing zeroes are thrown away.For example, if the number 1.14 is rounded to the first decimal place, the result is 1.1, while if we round 1.5 to the nearest integer, the result is 2.

"Qingshan and Daniel are going to play a card game. But it will be so boring if only two persons play this. So they will make n robots in total to play this game automatically. Robots made by Qingshan belong to the team 1, and robots made by Daniel belong to the team 2. Robot i belongs to team t_i. Before the game starts, a_i cards are given for robot i.The rules for this card game are simple:   Before the start, the robots are arranged in a circle in the order or their indices. The robots will discard cards in some order, in each step one robot discards a single card. When the game starts, robot 1 will discard one of its cards. After that, robots will follow the following rules:  If robot i discards the card last, the nearest robot whose team is opposite from i's will discard the card next. In another word j will discard a card right after i, if and only if among all j that satisfy t_i\ne t_j, dist(i,j) (definition is below) is minimum.  The robot who has no cards should quit the game immediately. This robot won't be considered in the next steps.  When no robot can discard the card next, the game ends. We define the distance from robot x to robot y as dist(x,y)=(y-x+n)\bmod n. It is similar to the oriented distance on the circle.For example, when n=5, the distance from 1 to 3 is dist(1,3)=(3-1+5)\bmod 5=2, the distance from 3 to 1 is dist(3,1)=(1-3+5)\bmod 5 =3.Later, Qingshan finds out that it will take so much time to see how robots play.

This year Vanya decided to take part in the race and drive his own car that has been around and bears its own noble name — The Huff-puffer.So, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very beginning he fills the petrol tank with α liters of petrol (α ≥ 10 is Vanya's favorite number, it is not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are located on the motorway at an interval of 100 kilometers, i.e. the first station is located 100 kilometers away from the city A, the second one is 200 kilometers away from the city A, the third one is 300 kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends 10 liters of petrol every 100 kilometers. Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills the tank with α liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn't stop at the station and drives on. For example, if α = 43.21, then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number 4, when there'll be 3.21 petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have 46.42 liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number 8 and ends up with 6.42 + 43.21 = 49.63 liters. The next stop is at the station number 12, 9.63 + 43.21 = 52.84. The next stop is at the station number 17 and so on. You won't believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins. Whatever the reason is, the Huff-puffer is leading, and jealous people together with other contestants wrack their brains trying to think of a way to stop that outrage.One way to do this is to mine the next petrol station where Vanya will stop. Your task is to calculate at which station this will happen and warn Vanya. You don't know the α number, however, you are given the succession of the numbers of the stations where Vanya has stopped.

"Masha works in an advertising agency. In order to promote the new brand, she wants to conclude contracts with some bloggers. In total, Masha has connections of n different bloggers. Blogger numbered i has a_i followers.Since Masha has a limited budget, she can only sign a contract with k different bloggers. Of course, Masha wants her ad to be seen by as many people as possible. Therefore, she must hire bloggers with the maximum total number of followers.Help her, find the number of ways to select k bloggers so that the total number of their followers is maximum possible. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one blogger in the first way, which is not in the second way. Masha believes that all bloggers have different followers (that is, there is no follower who would follow two different bloggers).For example, if n=4, k=3, a=[1, 3, 1, 2], then Masha has two ways to select 3 bloggers with the maximum total number of followers:   conclude contracts with bloggers with numbers 1, 2 and 4. In this case, the number of followers will be equal to a_1 + a_2 + a_4 = 6.  conclude contracts with bloggers with numbers 2, 3 and 4. In this case, the number of followers will be equal to a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 6. Since the answer can be quite large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

Each lock has a pipe attached to it. When the pipe is open, 1 liter of water enters the lock every second.The locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock i to the lock i + 1.

If there was no bullet in front of the trigger, the cylinder shifts by one position and the weapon is given to Roma for make the same move. The game continues until someone is shot, the survivor is the winner. Sasha does not want to lose, so he must choose slots for bullets in such a way as to minimize the probability of its own loss. Of all the possible variant he wants to select the lexicographically minimal one, where an empty slot is lexicographically less than a charged one. More formally, the cylinder of n bullet slots able to contain k bullets can be represented as a string of n characters. Exactly k of them are ""X"" (charged slots) and the others are ""."" (uncharged slots). Let us describe the process of a shot. Suppose that the trigger is in front of the first character of the string (the first slot). If a shot doesn't kill anyone and the cylinder shifts, then the string shifts left. So the first character becomes the last one, the second character becomes the first one, and so on.

It's well known that the factorial of an integer x is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to x. Thus x! = 1·2·3·...·(x - 1)·x. For example 4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24. Recall that GCD(x, y) is the largest positive integer q that divides (without a remainder) both x and y.Leha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you? Input: ['4 3'] Output:['6']",3
"Three little pigs from all over the world are meeting for a convention! Every minute, a triple of 3 new pigs arrives on the convention floor. After the n-th minute, the convention ends.The big bad wolf has learned about this convention, and he has an attack plan. At some minute in the convention, he will arrive and eat exactly x pigs. Then he will get away.The wolf wants Gregor to help him figure out the number of possible attack plans that involve eating exactly x pigs for various values of x (1 <= x <= 3n). Two attack plans are considered different, if they occur at different times or if the sets of little pigs to eat are different.Note that all queries are independent, that is, the wolf does not eat the little pigs, he only makes plans!

"Little Johnny has recently learned about set theory. Now he is studying binary relations. You've probably heard the term ""equivalence relation"". These relations are very important in many areas of mathematics. For example, the equality of the two numbers is an equivalence relation.A set ρ of pairs (a, b) of elements of some set A is called a binary relation on set A. For two elements a and b of the set A we say that they are in relation ρ, if pair , in this case we use a notation .Binary relation is equivalence relation, if: It is reflexive (for any a it is true that ); It is symmetric (for any a, b it is true that if , then ); It is transitive (if  and , than ).Little Johnny is not completely a fool and he noticed that the first condition is not necessary! Here is his ""proof"":Take any two elements, a and b. If , then  (according to property (2)), which means  (according to property (3)).It's very simple, isn't it?

"A few years ago, Hitagi encountered a giant crab, who stole the whole of her body weight. Ever since, she tried to avoid contact with others, for fear that this secret might be noticed.To get rid of the oddity and recover her weight, a special integer sequence is needed. Hitagi's sequence has been broken for a long time, but now Kaiki provides an opportunity.Hitagi's sequence a has a length of n. Lost elements in it are denoted by zeros. Kaiki provides another sequence b, whose length k equals the number of lost elements in a (i.e. the number of zeros). Hitagi is to replace each zero in a with an element from b so that each element in b should be used exactly once. Hitagi knows, however, that, apart from 0, no integer occurs in a and b more than once in total.If the resulting sequence is not an increasing sequence, then it has the power to recover Hitagi from the oddity. You are to determine whether this is possible, or Kaiki's sequence is just another fake.

Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.The lamp allows only good programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0 < a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{|a|} < M. All a_i must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.The lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment a_i the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1.

"Levko loves sports pathfinding competitions in his city very much. In order to boost his performance, Levko spends his spare time practicing. The practice is a game.The city consists of n intersections connected by m + k directed roads. Two or more roads can connect the same pair of intersections. Besides, there can be roads leading from an intersection to itself. Levko and Zenyk are playing a game. First Levko stands on intersection s1, and Zenyk stands on intersection s2. They both want to get to intersection f. The person who does it quicker wins. If they get there at the same time, the game ends with a draw. By agreement both players start simultaneously and move with the same speed.Levko wants to win very much. He knows the lengths of all the roads in the city. Also he knows that he can change the lengths of some roads (there are k such roads at all) if he pays the government. So, the government can change the length of the i-th road to any integer value in the segment [li, ri] (both borders inclusive). Levko wondered if he can reconstruct the roads so as to win the game and whether he can hope for the draw if he cannot win.You should consider that both players play optimally well. It is guaranteed that we can get from intersections s1 and s2 to intersection f.  Input: ['4 1 31 3 43 2 21 2 1 32 4 1 33 4 1 3'] Output:['WIN1 1 3 ']",2
"There are n people sitting in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in the order in which they are seated. That is, for all i from 1 to n-1, the people with id i and i+1 are adjacent. People with id n and 1 are adjacent as well.The person with id 1 initially has a ball. He picks a positive integer k at most n, and passes the ball to his k-th neighbour in the direction of increasing ids, that person passes the ball to his k-th neighbour in the same direction, and so on until the person with the id 1 gets the ball back. When he gets it back, people do not pass the ball any more.For instance, if n = 6 and k = 4, the ball is passed in order [1, 5, 3, 1]. Consider the set of all people that touched the ball. The fun value of the game is the sum of the ids of people that touched it. In the above example, the fun value would be 1 + 5 + 3 = 9.Find and report the set of possible fun values for all choices of positive integer k. It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem, the ball always gets back to the 1-st player after finitely many steps, and there are no more than 10^5 possible fun values for given n.

If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring, here is what it means. The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants. Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the round.Pay attention to the range bounds. For example, if 40 people are taking part in the round, and 10 of them solve a particular problem, then the solvers fraction is equal to 1 / 4, and the problem's maximum point value is equal to 1500.If the problem's maximum point value is equal to x, then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participant's correct submission, the participant loses x / 250 points. For example, if the problem's maximum point value is 2000, and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round, this participant will be awarded with 2000·(1 - 40 / 250) = 1680 points for this problem.There are n participants in the round, including Vasya and Petya.

Unfortunately, right now, Monocarp has no coins at all.Monocarp can earn gold coins by completing quests in the game. Each quest yields exactly one gold coin. Monocarp can also exchange coins via the in-game trading system. Monocarp has spent days analyzing the in-game economy; he came to the following conclusion: it is possible to sell one gold coin for a silver coins (i. e. Monocarp can lose one gold coin to gain a silver coins), or buy one gold coin for b silver coins (i. e. Monocarp can lose b silver coins to gain one gold coin).Now Monocarp wants to calculate the minimum number of quests that he has to complete in order to have at least n silver coins after some abuse of the in-game economy. Note that Monocarp can perform exchanges of both types (selling and buying gold coins for silver coins) any number of times.

But now a smaller task is to be performed, he should learn to complete the path fastest.The track's map is represented by a rectangle n × m in size divided into squares. Each square is marked with a lowercase Latin letter (which means the type of the plot), with the exception of the starting square (it is marked with a capital Latin letters S) and the terminating square (it is marked with a capital Latin letter T). The time of movement from one square to another is equal to 1 minute. The time of movement within the cell can be neglected. We can move from the cell only to side-adjacent ones, but it is forbidden to go beyond the map edges. Also the following restriction is imposed on the path: it is not allowed to visit more than k different types of squares (squares of one type can be visited an infinite number of times). Squares marked with S and T have no type, so they are not counted. But S must be visited exactly once — at the very beginning, and T must be visited exactly once — at the very end.Your task is to find the path from the square S to the square T that takes minimum time.

"Omkar is playing his favorite pixelated video game, Bed Wars! In Bed Wars, there are n players arranged in a circle, so that for all j such that 2 <=q j <=q n, player j - 1 is to the left of the player j, and player j is to the right of player j - 1. Additionally, player n is to the left of player 1, and player 1 is to the right of player n.Currently, each player is attacking either the player to their left or the player to their right. This means that each player is currently being attacked by either 0, 1, or 2 other players. A key element of Bed Wars strategy is that if a player is being attacked by exactly 1 other player, then they should logically attack that player in response. If instead a player is being attacked by 0 or 2 other players, then Bed Wars strategy says that the player can logically attack either of the adjacent players.Unfortunately, it might be that some players in this game are not following Bed Wars strategy correctly. Omkar is aware of whom each player is currently attacking, and he can talk to any amount of the n players in the game to make them instead attack another player  — i. e. if they are currently attacking the player to their left, Omkar can convince them to instead attack the player to their right; if they are currently attacking the player to their right, Omkar can convince them to instead attack the player to their left.

"A wild basilisk just appeared at your doorstep. You are not entirely sure what a basilisk is and you wonder whether it evolved from your favorite animal, the weasel. How can you find out whether basilisks evolved from weasels? Certainly, a good first step is to sequence both of their DNAs. Then you can try to check whether there is a sequence of possible mutations from the DNA of the weasel to the DNA of the basilisk. Your friend Ron is a talented alchemist and has studied DNA sequences in many of his experiments. He has found out that DNA strings consist of the letters A, B and C and that single mutations can only remove or add substrings at any position in the string (a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters). The substrings that can be removed or added by a mutation are AA, BB, CC, ABAB or BCBC. During a sequence of mutations a DNA string may even become empty.Ron has agreed to sequence the DNA of the weasel and the basilisk for you, but finding out whether there is a sequence of possible mutations that leads from one to the other is too difficult for him, so you have to do it on your own.

At any moment, she may move to one of the cells adjacent to where she is—in one of the four directions (i.e., up, down, left, or right).Unfortunately, Alice cannot swim, and there is no viable transportation means other than by foot (i.e., she can walk only on land). As a result, Alice's trip may be impossible.To help Alice, you plan to create at most one tunnel between some two land cells. The tunnel will allow Alice to freely travel between the two endpoints. Indeed, creating a tunnel is a lot of effort: the cost of creating a tunnel between cells (r_s, c_s) and (r_t, c_t) is (r_s-r_t)^2 + (c_s-c_t)^2.For now, your task is to find the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from (r_1, c_1) to (r_2, c_2). If no tunnel needs to be created, the cost is 0. Input: ['5', '1 1', '5 5', '00001', '11111', '00111', '00110', '00110', ''] Output:['10', '']",0
"A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a vertex v (different from root) is the previous to v vertex on the shortest path from the root to the vertex v. Children of the vertex v are all vertices for which v is the parent.A vertex is a leaf if it has no children. We call a vertex a bud, if the following three conditions are satisfied:   it is not a root,  it has at least one child, and  all its children are leaves. You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. The vertex 1 is the root. In one operation you can choose any bud with all its children (they are leaves) and re-hang them to any other vertex of the tree. By doing that you delete the edge connecting the bud and its parent and add an edge between the bud and the chosen vertex of the tree. The chosen vertex cannot be the bud itself or any of its children. All children of the bud stay connected to the bud.What is the minimum number of leaves it is possible to get if you can make any number of the above-mentioned operations (possibly zero)?

"  Recently, a wild Krakozyabra appeared at Jelly Castle. It is, truth to be said, always eager to have something for dinner.Its favorite meal is natural numbers (typically served with honey sauce), or, to be more precise, the zeros in their corresponding decimal representations. As for other digits, Krakozyabra dislikes them; moreover, they often cause it indigestion! So, as a necessary precaution, Krakozyabra prefers to sort the digits of a number in non-descending order before proceeding to feast. Then, the leading zeros of the resulting number are eaten and the remaining part is discarded as an inedible tail.For example, if Krakozyabra is to have the number 57040 for dinner, its inedible tail would be the number 457.Slastyona is not really fond of the idea of Krakozyabra living in her castle.

Each player wears a hat that is either black or white. As each player faces forward, player i knows the color of player j's hat if and only if i is larger than j.At the start of each turn, Orac will tell whether there exists a player wearing a black hat in the room.After Orac speaks, if the player can uniquely identify the color of his hat, he will put his hat on the chair, stand up and leave the room. All players are smart, so if it is possible to understand the color of their hat using the obtained information during this and previous rounds, they will understand it. In each turn, all players who know the color of their hats will leave at the same time in this turn, which means a player can only leave in the next turn if he gets to know the color of his hat only after someone left the room at this turn.Note that when the player needs to leave, he will put the hat on the chair before leaving, so the players ahead of him still cannot see his hat.

For example, the list [14, 24, 9, 19] satisfies this requirement, after sorting it makes a list [9, 14, 19, 24], which can be produced as x_n = 9 + 5 \cdot (n - 1).Also you are also given a device, which has a quite discharged battery, thus you can only use it to perform at most 60 queries of following two types: Given a value i (1 <= i <= n), the device will show the value of the a_i. Given a value x (0 <= x <= 10^9), the device will return 1 if an element with a value strictly greater than x exists, and it will return 0 otherwise.Your can use this special device for at most 60 queries. Could you please find out the smallest element and the common difference of the sequence? That is, values x_1 and d in the definition of the arithmetic progression. Note that the array a is not sorted.

"Polycarp is the project manager in the IT-company. Right now, he needs to choose developers for his team to start a new project. The company has n developers ""on the bench"" (i.e not involved in other projects). Polycarp assessed the skills of each of them: a_i (-10^4 <= a_i <= 10^4) — an integer characteristic of the i-th developer. This value can be either positive, zero or even negative (some developers cause distractions).After Polycarp chooses a subset of developers for his team, the strength of the team will be determined by the sum of a_i values for all selected developers.Polycarp fears that if he chooses a team in such a way that maximizes the sum of the characteristics of a_i, other managers may find this unacceptable. For this reason, he plans to create such a team that the sum of the a_i values for it is strictly less than the maximum possible value.Help Polycarp choose any team that:  the sum of the characteristics a_i for all members of the selected team is strictly less than the maximum value that can be achieved by choosing the team in some other way  and at the same time, the sum of the characteristics of a_i for all members of the selected team is the greatest possible. If, following the requirements above, you can select a team in several ways, then just find any of them.

In the end, they decided that they would take turns picking photos. Alice goes first.There are n stacks of photos. Each stack contains exactly two photos. In each turn, a player may take only a photo from the top of one of the stacks.Each photo is described by two non-negative integers a and b, indicating that it is worth a units of happiness to Alice and b units of happiness to Bonnie.

"There are n cities and n-1 two-way roads in Treeland. Each road connects a pair of different cities. From any city you can drive to any other, moving only along the roads. Cities are numbered from 1 to n. Yes, of course, you recognized an undirected tree in this description.There is exactly one flag in each city, in the i-th city the flag color is c_i. The colors of the flags in different cities may be the same.If the King travels along the route [u_1, u_2, u_3, ..., u_k], then this means that he starts in the city u_1, then moves to the city u_2 (u_2 is connected by road with u_1), then from u_2 to u_3 (u_3 is connected by road to u_2), and so on until he arrives in the city of u_k. It is possible that during this route the King will visit the same city more than once. In other words, the route [u_1, u_2, u_3, ..., u_k] does not necessarily consist of different cities. In terms of graph theory — the King moves from u_1 to u_k along some path [u_1, u_2, u_3, ..., u_k], which is not necessarily simple (for all j from 1 to k-1 of the city u_j and u_{j+1} are connected by road).When the King moves from one city to another, city heads exchange flags as a sign of their friendship.  Example of moving the King along the route [1, 4, 2, 6]. The color of the vertex matches the color of the flag at that vertex. For aesthetic reasons, the King wants the flag color in the city i to be equal to d_i for all i from 1 to n. Determine whether the King can choose some route and drive along it so that for each city the flag color in it turns out to be equal to the desired color d_i. Note that the King can choose (and drive) exactly one route.

Unlike other modern computers, ""Ternatron IV"" operates with ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the xor operation is performed on this computer (and whether there is anything like it).It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is called tor) and it works like this. Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression a tor b. Both numbers a and b are written in the ternary notation one under the other one (b under a). If they have a different number of digits, then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit. The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3. Note that there is no carry between digits (i. e. during this operation the digits aren't transferred).

"Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). Every object in this game consists of three-dimensional blocks — axis-aligned cubes of size 1 * 1 * 1. These blocks are unaffected by gravity, so they can float in the air without support. The blocks are placed in cells of size 1 * 1 * 1; each cell either contains exactly one block or is empty. Each cell is represented by its coordinates (x, y, z) (the cell with these coordinates is a cube with opposite corners in (x, y, z) and (x + 1, y + 1, z + 1)) and its contents a_{x, y, z}; if the cell is empty, then a_{x, y, z} = 0, otherwise a_{x, y, z} is equal to the type of the block placed in it (the types are integers from 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5).Polycarp has built a large structure consisting of blocks. This structure can be enclosed in an axis-aligned rectangular parallelepiped of size n * m * k, containing all cells (x, y, z) such that x \in [1, n], y \in [1, m], and z \in [1, k]. After that, Polycarp has installed 2nm + 2nk + 2mk sensors around this parallelepiped. A sensor is a special block that sends a ray in some direction and shows the type of the first block that was hit by this ray (except for other sensors). The sensors installed by Polycarp are adjacent to the borders of the parallelepiped, and the rays sent by them are parallel to one of the coordinate axes and directed inside the parallelepiped. More formally, the sensors can be divided into 6 types:  there are mk sensors of the first type; each such sensor is installed in (0, y, z), where y \in [1, m] and z \in [1, k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Ox axis and has the same direction;  there are mk sensors of the second type; each such sensor is installed in (n + 1, y, z), where y \in [1, m] and z \in [1, k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Ox axis and has the opposite direction;  there are nk sensors of the third type; each such sensor is installed in (x, 0, z), where x \in [1, n] and z \in [1, k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oy axis and has the same direction;  there are nk sensors of the fourth type; each such sensor is installed in (x, m + 1, z), where x \in [1, n] and z \in [1, k], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oy axis and has the opposite direction;  there are nm sensors of the fifth type; each such sensor is installed in (x, y, 0), where x \in [1, n] and y \in [1, m], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oz axis and has the same direction;  finally, there are nm sensors of the sixth type; each such sensor is installed in (x, y, k + 1), where x \in [1, n] and y \in [1, m], and it sends a ray that is parallel to the Oz axis and has the opposite direction. Polycarp has invited his friend Monocarp to play with him. Of course, as soon as Monocarp saw a large parallelepiped bounded by sensor blocks, he began to wonder what was inside of it. Polycarp didn't want to tell Monocarp the exact shape of the figure, so he provided Monocarp with the data from all sensors and told him to try guessing the contents of the parallelepiped by himself.After some hours of thinking, Monocarp has no clue about what's inside the sensor-bounded space.

We have measured the temperatures during these n days; the temperature during i-th day equals a_i.We denote the average temperature of a segment of some consecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during this segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from day x to day y, we calculate it as \frac{\sum \limits_{i = x}^{y} a_i}{y - x + 1} (note that division is performed without any rounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures over all segments of not less than k consecutive days. For example, if analyzing the measures [3, 4, 1, 2] and k = 3, we are interested in segments [3, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2] and [3, 4, 1, 2] (we want to find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments).You have been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would compute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this task? Input: ['4 33 4 1 2'] Output:['2.666666666666667']",0
"Alice has a cute cat. To keep her cat fit, Alice wants to design an exercising walk for her cat! Initially, Alice's cat is located in a cell (x,y) of an infinite grid. According to Alice's theory, cat needs to move:   exactly a steps left: from (u,v) to (u-1,v);  exactly b steps right: from (u,v) to (u+1,v);  exactly c steps down: from (u,v) to (u,v-1);  exactly d steps up: from (u,v) to (u,v+1). Note that the moves can be performed in an arbitrary order. For example, if the cat has to move 1 step left, 3 steps right and 2 steps down, then the walk right, down, left, right, right, down is valid.Alice, however, is worrying that her cat might get lost if it moves far away from her. So she hopes that her cat is always in the area [x_1,x_2]* [y_1,y_2], i.e. for every cat's position (u,v) of a walk x_1 <= u <= x_2 and y_1 <= v <= y_2 holds.Also, note that the cat can visit the same cell multiple times.Can you help Alice find out if there exists a walk satisfying her wishes?Formally, the walk should contain exactly a+b+c+d unit moves (a to the left, b to the right, c to the down, d to the up). Alice can do the moves in any order. Her current position (u, v) should always satisfy the constraints: x_1 <= u <= x_2, y_1 <= v <= y_2.

We call two nesting places adjacent if there exists a branch between them. A simple path from nesting place x to y is given by a sequence s_0, ..., s_p of distinct nesting places, where p is a non-negative integer, s_0 = x, s_p = y, and s_{i-1} and s_{i} are adjacent for each i = 1, ..., p. The branches of The Oak are set up in such a way that for any two pairs of nesting places x and y, there exists a unique simple path from x to y.

A set of villages \cal P is called a partition if each of the n nesting places is contained in exactly one of the villages in \cal P. In other words, no two villages in \cal P share any common nesting place, and altogether, they contain all n nesting places.The Oak holds its annual Miss Punyverse beauty pageant.

The circuits we'll consider will be formed from individual resistors joined together in series or in parallel, forming more complex circuits.

According to your friend Kirchhoff, the effective resistance can be calculated quite easily when joining circuits this way:  When joining k circuits in series with effective resistances R_1, R_2, ..., R_k, the effective resistance R of the resulting circuit is the sum R = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_k.  When joining k circuits in parallel with effective resistances R_1, R_2, ..., R_k, the effective resistance R of the resulting circuit is found by solving for R in \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_k}, assuming all R_i > 0; if at least one R_i = 0, then the effective resistance of the whole circuit is simply R = 0.

In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.
The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi.
Return the probability that after t seconds the frog is on the vertex target. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

"Your program fails again. This time it gets ""Wrong answer on test 233"".This is the harder version of the problem. In this version, 1 <= n <= 2\cdot10^5. You can hack this problem if you locked it. But you can hack the previous problem only if you locked both problems.The problem is to finish n one-choice-questions. Each of the questions contains k options, and only one of them is correct. The answer to the i-th question is h_{i}, and if your answer of the question i is h_{i}, you earn 1 point, otherwise, you earn 0 points for this question. The values h_1, h_2, ..., h_n are known to you in this problem.However, you have a mistake in your program. It moves the answer clockwise! Consider all the n answers are written in a circle. Due to the mistake in your program, they are shifted by one cyclically.Formally, the mistake moves the answer for the question i to the question i \bmod n + 1. So it moves the answer for the question 1 to question 2, the answer for the question 2 to the question 3, ..., the answer for the question n to the question 1.We call all the n answers together an answer suit. There are k^n possible answer suits in total.You're wondering, how many answer suits satisfy the following condition: after moving clockwise by 1, the total number of points of the new answer suit is strictly larger than the number of points of the old one. You need to find the answer modulo 998\,244\,353.For example, if n = 5, and your answer suit is a=[1,2,3,4,5], it will submitted as a'=[5,1,2,3,4] because of a mistake. If the correct answer suit is h=[5,2,2,3,4], the answer suit a earns 1 point and the answer suite a' earns 4 points. Since 4 > 1, the answer suit a=[1,2,3,4,5] should be counted.

That is, the deadline before the i-th task is a_i hours.

Initially, his completion rate for each task is 0 percent.Vitaly has m training options, each option can be used not more than once. The ith option is characterized by three integers: e_i, t_i and p_i.

In order to go to room x from room x - 1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. In total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type t can open the door of type T if and only if t and T are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.Each of the first n - 1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room.

If two digits are not equal, then the player, whose digit is smaller gets a flick (knock in the forehead usually made with a forefinger) from the other player. For example, if n = 3, Sherlock's card is 123 and Moriarty's card has number 321, first Sherlock names 1 and Moriarty names 3 so Sherlock gets a flick. Then they both digit 2 so no one gets a flick. Finally, Sherlock names 3, while Moriarty names 1 and gets a flick.Of course, Sherlock will play honestly naming digits one by one in the order they are given, while Moriary, as a true villain, plans to cheat. He is going to name his digits in some other order (however, he is not going to change the overall number of occurences of each digit). For example, in case above Moriarty could name 1, 2, 3 and get no flicks at all, or he can name 2, 3 and 1 to give Sherlock two flicks.Your goal is to find out the minimum possible number of flicks Moriarty will get (no one likes flicks) and the maximum possible number of flicks Sherlock can get from Moriarty. Note, that these two goals are different and the optimal result may be obtained by using different strategies. Input: ['3123321'] Output:['02']",2

"There are n cities in Berland. Some pairs of cities are connected by roads. All roads are bidirectional. Each road connects two different cities. There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The cities are numbered from 1 to n.It is known that, from the capital (the city with the number 1), you can reach any other city by moving along the roads.The President of Berland plans to improve the country's road network. The budget is enough to repair exactly n-1 roads. The President plans to choose a set of n-1 roads such that:  it is possible to travel from the capital to any other city along the n-1 chosen roads,  if d_i is the number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i, moving only along the n-1 chosen roads, then d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_n is minimized (i.e. as minimal as possible). In other words, the set of n-1 roads should preserve the connectivity of the country, and the sum of distances from city 1 to all cities should be minimized (where you can only use the n-1 chosen roads).The president instructed the ministry to prepare k possible options to choose n-1 roads so that both conditions above are met.Write a program that will find k possible ways to choose roads for repair. If there are fewer than k ways, then the program should output all possible valid ways to choose roads. Input: ['4 4 31 22 31 44 3'] Output:['211101011']",0
"Casimir has a string s which consists of capital Latin letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:  he can either erase exactly one letter 'A' and exactly one letter 'B' from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent);  or he can erase exactly one letter 'B' and exactly one letter 'C' from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don't have to be adjacent). Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by 2. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.For example, with s = ""ABCABC"" he can obtain a string s = ""ACBC"" in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of 'B' and the second occurrence of 'A'). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.For a given string s determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir's goal is to erase all letters from the string. Is there a way to do this?

Shrek's stars were to the right of the chimney and the Donkey's stars were to the left. Most days the Donkey would just count the stars, so he knew that they are exactly n. This time he wanted a challenge. He imagined a coordinate system: he put the origin of the coordinates at the intersection of the roof and the chimney, directed the OX axis to the left along the roof and the OY axis — up along the chimney (see figure). The Donkey imagined two rays emanating from he origin of axes at angles α1 and α2 to the OX axis.  Now he chooses any star that lies strictly between these rays. After that he imagines more rays that emanate from this star at the same angles α1 and α2 to the OX axis and chooses another star that lies strictly between the new rays. He repeats the operation as long as there still are stars he can choose between the rays that emanate from a star.   As a result, the Donkey gets a chain of stars.

In the final project, n students will participate in a choreography described below.n students are positioned on the positive side of the Ox-axis. The i-th dancer is located at a_i > 0. Some dancers will change positions during the dance (we'll call them movable dancers), and others will stay in the same place during a choreography (we'll call them immovable dancers). We distinguish the dancers using a binary string s of length n: if s_i equals '1', then the i-th dancer is movable, otherwise the i-th dancer is immovable.Let's call the ""positive energy value"" of the choreography d > 0. The dancers will perform ""movements"" based on this value.Each minute after the dance begins, the movable dancer with the smallest x-coordinate will start moving to the right and initiate a ""movement"". At the beginning of the movement, the dancer's energy level will be initiated equally to the positive energy value of the choreography, which is d. Each time they move from some y to y+1, the energy level will be decreased by 1. At some point, the dancer might meet other fellow dancers in the same coordinates. If it happens, then the energy level of the dancer will be increased by 1. A dancer will stop moving to the right when his energy level reaches 0, and he doesn't share a position with another dancer.The dancers are very well-trained, and each ""movement"" will end before the next minute begins.To show her understanding of this choreography, Ela has to answer q queries, each consisting of two integers k and m.

"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:
Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.

dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2

Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

"Kevin has just recevied his disappointing results on the USA Identification of Cows Olympiad (USAICO) in the form of a binary string of length n. Each character of Kevin's string represents Kevin's score on one of the n questions of the olympiad—'1' for a correctly identified cow and '0' otherwise.However, all is not lost. Kevin is a big proponent of alternative thinking and believes that his score, instead of being the sum of his points, should be the length of the longest alternating subsequence of his string. Here, we define an alternating subsequence of a string as a not-necessarily contiguous subsequence where no two consecutive elements are equal. For example, {0, 1, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, and {1, 0, 1, 0} are alternating sequences, while {1, 0, 0} and {0, 1, 0, 1, 1} are not.Kevin, being the sneaky little puffball that he is, is willing to hack into the USAICO databases to improve his score. In order to be subtle, he decides that he will flip exactly one substring—that is, take a contiguous non-empty substring of his score and change all '0's in that substring to '1's and vice versa. After such an operation, Kevin wants to know the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence that his string could have. Input: ['810000011'] Output:['5']",2

For example, the numbers 0, 1, 3, 7, 15 and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on x:  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer n and replace x with x \oplus (2^n - 1), with \oplus being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace x with x + 1. The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most 40 operations.

The i-th wave consists of a_i monsters and happens from the l_i-th moment of time up to the r_i-th moments of time. All a_i monsters spawn at moment l_i and you have to exterminate all of them before the moment r_i ends (you can kill monsters right at moment r_i). For every two consecutive waves, the second wave starts not earlier than the first wave ends (though the second wave can start at the same moment when the first wave ends) — formally, the condition r_i <= l_{i + 1} holds. Take a look at the notes for the examples to understand the process better.You are confident in yours and your character's skills so you can assume that aiming and shooting are instant and you need exactly one bullet to kill one monster. But reloading takes exactly 1 unit of time.One of the realistic mechanics is a mechanic of reloading: when you reload you throw away the old magazine with all remaining bullets in it. That's why constant reloads may cost you excessive amounts of spent bullets.You've taken a liking to this mechanic so now you are wondering: what is the minimum possible number of bullets you need to spend (both used and thrown) to exterminate all waves.Note that you don't throw the remaining bullets away after eradicating all monsters, and you start with a full magazine.

First the first child throws the ball to the next one clockwise, i.e. to the child number 2.

It should be mentioned that when a ball is thrown it may pass the beginning of the circle. For example, if n = 5, then after the third throw the child number 2 has the ball again. Overall, n - 1 throws are made, and the game ends.The problem is that not all the children get the ball during the game.

"For months Maxim has been coming to work on his favorite bicycle. And quite recently he decided that he is ready to take part in a cyclists' competitions.He knows that this year n competitions will take place. During the i-th competition the participant must as quickly as possible complete a ride along a straight line from point si to point fi (si < fi).Measuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter. Think of the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius r. Let's neglect the thickness of a tire, the size of the sensor, and all physical effects. The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a circle of radius r. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle.At the beginning each participant can choose any point bi, such that his bike is fully behind the starting line, that is, bi < si - r. After that, he starts the movement, instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time tsi, when the coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start, the time counter starts. The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish (moment of time tfi), the time counter deactivates and records the final time. Thus, the counter records that the participant made a complete ride in time tfi - tsi.  Maxim is good at math and he suspects that the total result doesn't only depend on his maximum speed v, but also on his choice of the initial point bi. Now Maxim is asking you to calculate for each of n competitions the minimum possible time that can be measured by the time counter. The radius of the wheel of his bike is equal to r.

Append the MEX of the first k numbers of the array a to the end of array b and erase them from the array a, shifting the positions of the remaining numbers in a.

Due to this, if Olya's fridge contains a carton past its expiry date, she throws it away.Olya hates throwing out cartons, so when she drinks a carton, she chooses the one which expires the fastest. It's easy to understand that this strategy minimizes the amount of cartons thrown out and lets her avoid it if it's even possible.  Milk. Best before: 20.02.2017. The main issue Olya has is the one of buying new cartons. Currently, there are n cartons of milk in Olya's fridge, for each one an expiration date is known (how soon does it expire, measured in days). In the shop that Olya visited there are m cartons, and the expiration date is known for each of those cartons as well.Find the maximum number of cartons Olya can buy so that she wouldn't have to throw away any cartons.

"For long time scientists study the behavior of sharks. Sharks, as many other species, alternate short movements in a certain location and long movements between locations.Max is a young biologist. For n days he watched a specific shark, and now he knows the distance the shark traveled in each of the days. All the distances are distinct. Max wants to know now how many locations the shark visited. He assumed there is such an integer k that if the shark in some day traveled the distance strictly less than k, then it didn't change the location; otherwise, if in one day the shark traveled the distance greater than or equal to k; then it was changing a location in that day. Note that it is possible that the shark changed a location for several consecutive days, in each of them the shark traveled the distance at least k.The shark never returned to the same location after it has moved from it. Thus, in the sequence of n days we can find consecutive nonempty segments when the shark traveled the distance less than k in each of the days: each such segment corresponds to one location. Max wants to choose such k that the lengths of all such segments are equal.Find such integer k, that the number of locations is as large as possible. If there are several such k, print the smallest one. Input: ['81 2 7 3 4 8 5 6'] Output:['7']",0

A tree is a connected graph with n - 1 edges.Let us define its k-coloring as an assignment of k colors to the edges so that each edge has exactly one color assigned to it. Note that you don't have to use all k colors.A subgraph of color x consists of these edges from the original tree, which are assigned color x, and only those vertices that are adjacent to at least one such edge. So there are no vertices of degree 0 in such a subgraph.The value of a connected component is the sum of weights of its vertices. Let us define the value of a subgraph as a maximum of values of its connected components. We will assume that the value of an empty subgraph equals 0.There is also a value of a k-coloring, which equals the sum of values of subgraphs of all k colors.

This conclusion was reached long ago by the Martian aliens, as well as a number of other intelligent civilizations from outer space. Sometimes cows gather into cowavans. This seems to be seasonal. But at this time the cows become passive and react poorly to external stimuli. A cowavan is a perfect target for the Martian scientific saucer, it's time for large-scale abductions, or, as the Martians say, raids. Simply put, a cowavan is a set of cows in a row. If we number all cows in the cowavan with positive integers from 1 to n, then we can formalize the popular model of abduction, known as the (a, b)-Cowavan Raid: first they steal a cow number a, then number a + b, then — number a + 2·b, and so on, until the number of an abducted cow exceeds n. During one raid the cows are not renumbered. The aliens would be happy to place all the cows on board of their hospitable ship, but unfortunately, the amount of cargo space is very, very limited. The researchers, knowing the mass of each cow in the cowavan, made p scenarios of the (a, b)-raid.

" Morning desert sun horizonRise above the sands of time...Fates Warning, ""Exodus""After crossing the Windswept Wastes, Ori has finally reached the Windtorn Ruins to find the Heart of the Forest! However, the ancient repository containing this priceless Willow light did not want to open!Ori was taken aback, but the Voice of the Forest explained to him that the cunning Gorleks had decided to add protection to the repository.The Gorleks were very fond of the ""string expansion"" operation. They were also very fond of increasing subsequences.Suppose a string s_1s_2s_3 ... s_n is given. Then its ""expansion"" is defined as the sequence of strings s_1, s_1 s_2, ..., s_1 s_2 ... s_n, s_2, s_2 s_3, ..., s_2 s_3 ... s_n, s_3, s_3 s_4, ..., s_{n-1} s_n, s_n. For example, the ""expansion"" the string 'abcd' will be the following sequence of strings: 'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'b', 'bc', 'bcd', 'c', 'cd', 'd'. To open the ancient repository, Ori must find the size of the largest increasing subsequence of the ""expansion"" of the string s. Here, strings are compared lexicographically.Help Ori with this task!A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: a is a prefix of b, but a!=b; in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

"Jzzhu has a big rectangular chocolate bar that consists of n × m unit squares. He wants to cut this bar exactly k times. Each cut must meet the following requirements:  each cut should be straight (horizontal or vertical);  each cut should go along edges of unit squares (it is prohibited to divide any unit chocolate square with cut);  each cut should go inside the whole chocolate bar, and all cuts must be distinct. The picture below shows a possible way to cut a 5 × 6 chocolate for 5 times.  Imagine Jzzhu have made k cuts and the big chocolate is splitted into several pieces. Consider the smallest (by area) piece of the chocolate, Jzzhu wants this piece to be as large as possible. What is the maximum possible area of smallest piece he can get with exactly k cuts? The area of a chocolate piece is the number of unit squares in it. Input: ['3 4 1'] Output:['6']",2

"This is a hard version of the problem. In this version, the given array can contain equal elements and the constraints on n are greater than in the easy version of the problem.You are given an array a of n integers (the given array can contain equal elements). You can perform the following operations on array elements:  choose any index i (1 <= i <= n) and move the element a[i] to the begin of the array;  choose any index i (1 <= i <= n) and move the element a[i] to the end of the array. For example, if n = 5, a = [4, 7, 2, 2, 9], then the following sequence of operations can be performed:   after performing the operation of the first type to the second element, the array a will become [7, 4, 2, 2, 9];  after performing the operation of the second type to the second element, the array a will become [7, 2, 2, 9, 4]. You can perform operations of any type any number of times in any order.Find the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type that will make the a array sorted in non-decreasing order.

I didn't watch any part of the franchise and don't know its heroes well, but it won't stop me from using them in this problem statement. So, Thanos and Dr. Strange are doing their superhero and supervillain stuff, but then suddenly they stumble across a regular competitive programming problem.You are given a tree with n vertices.In each vertex v there is positive integer a_{v}.You have to answer q queries.Each query has a from u v x.You have to calculate \prod_{w \in P} gcd(x, a_{w}) \mod (10^{9} + 7), where P is a set of vertices on path from u to v. In other words, you are to calculate the product of gcd(x, a_{w}) for all vertices w on the path from u to v. As it might be large, compute it modulo 10^9+7. Here gcd(s, t) denotes the greatest common divisor of s and t.Note that the numbers in vertices do not change after queries.I suppose that you are more interested in superhero business of Thanos and Dr. Strange than in them solving the problem.

"Welcome! Everything is fine.You have arrived in The Medium Place, the place between The Good Place and The Bad Place. You are assigned a task that will either make people happier or torture them for eternity.You have a list of k pairs of people who have arrived in a new inhabited neighborhood. You need to assign each of the 2k people into one of the 2k houses. Each person will be the resident of exactly one house, and each house will have exactly one resident.Of course, in the neighborhood, it is possible to visit friends. There are 2k - 1 roads, each of which connects two houses. It takes some time to traverse a road. We will specify the amount of time it takes in the input. The neighborhood is designed in such a way that from anyone's house, there is exactly one sequence of distinct roads you can take to any other house. In other words, the graph with the houses as vertices and the roads as edges is a tree.The truth is, these k pairs of people are actually soulmates. We index them from 1 to k. We denote by f(i) the amount of time it takes for the i-th pair of soulmates to go to each other's houses.As we have said before, you will need to assign each of the 2k people into one of the 2k houses. You have two missions, one from the entities in The Good Place and one from the entities of The Bad Place. Here they are:  The first mission, from The Good Place, is to assign the people into the houses such that the sum of f(i) over all pairs i is minimized. Let's define this minimized sum as G. This makes sure that soulmates can easily and efficiently visit each other;  The second mission, from The Bad Place, is to assign the people into the houses such that the sum of f(i) over all pairs i is maximized. Let's define this maximized sum as B. This makes sure that soulmates will have a difficult time to visit each other. What are the values of G and B?

"Katya recently started to invent programming tasks and prepare her own contests. What she does not like is boring and simple constraints. Katya is fed up with all those ""N does not exceed a thousand"" and ""the sum of ai does not exceed a million"" and she decided to come up with something a little more complicated.The last problem written by Katya deals with strings. The input is a string of small Latin letters. To make the statement longer and strike terror into the people who will solve the contest, Katya came up with the following set of k restrictions of the same type (characters in restrictions can be repeated and some restrictions may contradict each other):   The number of characters c1 in a string is not less than l1 and not more than r1.  ...  The number of characters ci in a string is not less than li and not more than ri.  ...  The number of characters ck in a string is not less than lk and not more than rk. However, having decided that it is too simple and obvious, Katya added the following condition: a string meets no less than L and not more than R constraints from the above given list.Katya does not like to compose difficult and mean tests, so she just took a big string s and wants to add to the tests all its substrings that meet the constraints. However, Katya got lost in her conditions and asked you to count the number of substrings of the string s that meet the conditions (each occurrence of the substring is counted separately).
