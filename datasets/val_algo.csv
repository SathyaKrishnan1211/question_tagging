"Given a string s, return the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.
A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.
Two sequences a1, a2, ... and b1, b2, ... are different if there is some i for which ai != bi.
   Input: s = ""bccb""
Output: 6

"There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array classes, where classes[i] = [passi, totali]. You know beforehand that in the ith class, there are totali total students, but only passi number of students will pass the exam.
You are also given an integer extraStudents. There are another extraStudents brilliant students that are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the extraStudents students to a class in a way that maximizes the average pass ratio across all the classes.
The pass ratio of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.
Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the extraStudents students. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

"Vova again tries to play some computer card game.The rules of deck creation in this game are simple. Vova is given an existing deck of n cards and a magic number k. The order of the cards in the deck is fixed. Each card has a number written on it; number ai is written on the i-th card in the deck.After receiving the deck and the magic number, Vova removes x (possibly x = 0) cards from the top of the deck, y (possibly y = 0) cards from the bottom of the deck, and the rest of the deck is his new deck (Vova has to leave at least one card in the deck after removing cards). So Vova's new deck actually contains cards x + 1, x + 2, ... n - y - 1, n - y from the original deck.Vova's new deck is considered valid iff the product of all numbers written on the cards in his new deck is divisible by k. So Vova received a deck (possibly not a valid one) and a number k, and now he wonders, how many ways are there to choose x and y so the deck he will get after removing x cards from the top and y cards from the bottom is valid?

"There is a binary string a of length n. In one operation, you can select any prefix of a with an equal number of 0 and 1 symbols. Then all symbols in the prefix are inverted: each 0 becomes 1 and each 1 becomes 0.For example, suppose a=0111010000.   In the first operation, we can select the prefix of length 8 since it has four 0's and four 1's: [01110100]00\to [10001011]00.  In the second operation, we can select the prefix of length 2 since it has one 0 and one 1: [10]00101100\to [01]00101100.  It is illegal to select the prefix of length 4 for the third operation, because it has three 0's and one 1. Can you transform the string a into the string b using some finite number of operations (possibly, none)?

"Barney lives in country USC (United States of Charzeh). USC has n cities numbered from 1 through n and n - 1 roads between them. Cities and roads of USC form a rooted tree (Barney's not sure why it is rooted). Root of the tree is the city number 1. Thus if one will start his journey from city 1, he can visit any city he wants by following roads.  Some girl has stolen Barney's heart, and Barney wants to find her. He starts looking for in the root of the tree and (since he is Barney Stinson not a random guy), he uses a random DFS to search in the cities. A pseudo code of this algorithm is as follows:let starting_time be an array of length ncurrent_time = 0dfs(v):	current_time = current_time + 1	starting_time[v] = current_time	shuffle children[v] randomly (each permutation with equal possibility)	// children[v] is vector of children cities of city v	for u in children[v]:		dfs(u)As told before, Barney will start his journey in the root of the tree (equivalent to call dfs(1)).Now Barney needs to pack a backpack and so he wants to know more about his upcoming journey: for every city i, Barney wants to know the expected value of starting_time[i].

"MisoilePunch♪ - 彩This is an interactive problem!On a normal day at the hidden office in A.R.C. Markland-N, Rin received an artifact, given to her by the exploration captain Sagar.After much analysis, she now realizes that this artifact contains data about a strange flower, which has existed way before the New Age. However, the information about its chemical structure has been encrypted heavily.The chemical structure of this flower can be represented as a string p. From the unencrypted papers included, Rin already knows the length n of that string, and she can also conclude that the string contains at most three distinct letters: ""C"" (as in Carbon), ""H"" (as in Hydrogen), and ""O"" (as in Oxygen).At each moment, Rin can input a string s of an arbitrary length into the artifact's terminal, and it will return every starting position of s as a substring of p.However, the artifact has limited energy and cannot be recharged in any way, since the technology is way too ancient and is incompatible with any current A.R.C.'s devices. To be specific:  The artifact only contains \frac{7}{5} units of energy.  For each time Rin inputs a string s of length t, the artifact consumes \frac{1}{t^2} units of energy.  If the amount of energy reaches below zero, the task will be considered failed immediately, as the artifact will go black forever. Since the artifact is so precious yet fragile, Rin is very nervous to attempt to crack the final data. Can you give her a helping hand?

"Let's say you are standing on the XY-plane at point (0, 0) and you want to reach point (n, n).You can move only in two directions:   to the right, i. e. horizontally and in the direction that increase your x coordinate,  or up, i. e. vertically and in the direction that increase your y coordinate. In other words, your path will have the following structure:   initially, you choose to go to the right or up;  then you go some positive integer distance in the chosen direction (distances can be chosen independently);  after that you change your direction (from right to up, or from up to right) and repeat the process. You don't like to change your direction too much, so you will make no more than n - 1 direction changes.As a result, your path will be a polygonal chain from (0, 0) to (n, n), consisting of at most n line segments where each segment has positive integer length and vertical and horizontal segments alternate.Not all paths are equal. You have n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n where c_i is the cost of the i-th segment.Using these costs we can define the cost of the path as the sum of lengths of the segments of this path multiplied by their cost, i. e. if the path consists of k segments (k <= n), then the cost of the path is equal to \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}{c_i \cdot length_i} (segments are numbered from 1 to k in the order they are in the path).Find the path of the minimum cost and print its cost.

Unlike Earth, this planet is flat and can be represented as an n * m rectangle.Tema's character is located at the point with coordinates (0, 0). In order to successfully complete the mission, he needs to reach the point with coordinates (n, m) alive.Let the character of the computer game be located at the coordinate (i, j). Every second, starting from the first, Tema can:  either use vertical hyperjump technology, after which his character will end up at coordinate (i + 1, j) at the end of the second;  or use horizontal hyperjump technology, after which his character will end up at coordinate (i, j + 1) at the end of the second;  or Tema can choose not to make a hyperjump, in which case his character will not move during this second; The aliens that inhabit this planet are very dangerous and hostile.

"Little Petya very much likes computers. Recently he has received a new ""Ternatron IV"" as a gift from his mother. Unlike other modern computers, ""Ternatron IV"" operates with ternary and not binary logic. Petya immediately wondered how the xor operation is performed on this computer (and whether there is anything like it).It turned out that the operation does exist (however, it is called tor) and it works like this. Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression a tor b. Both numbers a and b are written in the ternary notation one under the other one (b under a). If they have a different number of digits, then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same. Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit. The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3. Note that there is no carry between digits (i. e. during this operation the digits aren't transferred). For example: 1410 tor 5010 = 01123 tor 12123 = 10213 = 3410.Petya wrote numbers a and c on a piece of paper. Help him find such number b, that a tor b = c.

"One tradition of welcoming the New Year is launching fireworks into the sky. Usually a launched firework flies vertically upward for some period of time, then explodes, splitting into several parts flying in different directions. Sometimes those parts also explode after some period of time, splitting into even more parts, and so on.Limak, who lives in an infinite grid, has a single firework. The behaviour of the firework is described with a recursion depth n and a duration for each level of recursion t1, t2, ..., tn. Once Limak launches the firework in some cell, the firework starts moving upward. After covering t1 cells (including the starting cell), it explodes and splits into two parts, each moving in the direction changed by 45 degrees (see the pictures below for clarification). So, one part moves in the top-left direction, while the other one moves in the top-right direction. Each part explodes again after covering t2 cells, splitting into two parts moving in directions again changed by 45 degrees. The process continues till the n-th level of recursion, when all 2n - 1 existing parts explode and disappear without creating new parts. After a few levels of recursion, it's possible that some parts will be at the same place and at the same time — it is allowed and such parts do not crash.Before launching the firework, Limak must make sure that nobody stands in cells which will be visited at least once by the firework.

"As you know, Martian scientists are actively engaged in space research. One of the highest priorities is Pluto. In order to study this planet in more detail, it was decided to build a laboratory on Pluto.It is known that the lab will be built of n square blocks of equal size. For convenience, we will assume that Pluto's surface is a plane divided by vertical and horizontal lines into unit squares. Each square is either occupied by a lab block or not, and only n squares are occupied.Since each block is square, it has four walls. If a wall is adjacent to another block, it is considered inside, otherwise — outside.Pluto is famous for its extremely cold temperatures, so the outside walls of the lab must be insulated. One unit of insulation per exterior wall would be required. Thus, the greater the total length of the outside walls of the lab (i. e., its perimeter), the more insulation will be needed.Consider the lab layout in the figure below. It shows that the lab consists of n = 33 blocks, and all the blocks have a total of 24 outside walls, i. e. 24 units of insulation will be needed.You should build the lab optimally, i. e., minimize the amount of insulation. On the other hand, there may be many optimal options, so scientists may be interested in the number of ways to build the lab using the minimum amount of insulation, modulo a prime number m.Two ways are considered the same if they are the same when overlapping without turning. Thus, if a lab plan is rotated by 90^{\circ}, such a new plan can be considered a separate way.To help scientists explore Pluto, you need to write a program that solves these difficult problems.

His opponent adds exactly a letters on each move.Mister B quickly understood that his opponent was just a computer that used a simple algorithm.

"Valera has a strip infinite in both directions and consisting of cells. The cells are numbered by integers. The cell number 0 has a robot.The robot has instructions — the sequence of moves that he must perform. In one move, the robot moves one cell to the left or one cell to the right, according to instructions. Before the robot starts moving, Valera puts obstacles in some cells of the strip, excluding cell number 0. If the robot should go into the cell with an obstacle according the instructions, it will skip this move.Also Valera indicates the finish cell in which the robot has to be after completing the entire instructions. The finishing cell should be different from the starting one. It is believed that the robot completed the instructions successfully, if during the process of moving he visited the finish cell exactly once — at its last move. Moreover, the latter move cannot be skipped.Let's assume that k is the minimum number of obstacles that Valera must put to make the robot able to complete the entire sequence of instructions successfully and end up in some finishing cell. You need to calculate in how many ways Valera can choose k obstacles and the finishing cell so that the robot is able to complete the instructions successfully. Input: ['RR'] Output:['1']",2

He can choose any city in the Binary Country (including Ai) as the terminal city for a tour. He gains happiness (Hi - L) during a tour, where L is the distance between the city Ai and the terminal city.Ralph is interested in tours from Ai in which he can gain positive happiness. For each query, compute the sum of happiness gains for all such tours.Ralph will never take the same tour twice or more (in one query), he will never pass the same city twice or more in one tour.

"Peter Parker wants to play a game with Dr. Octopus. The game is about cycles. Cycle is a sequence of vertices, such that first one is connected with the second, second is connected with third and so on, while the last one is connected with the first one again. Cycle may consist of a single isolated vertex.Initially there are k cycles, i-th of them consisting of exactly vi vertices. Players play alternatively. Peter goes first. On each turn a player must choose a cycle with at least 2 vertices (for example, x vertices) among all available cycles and replace it by two cycles with p and x - p vertices where 1 ≤ p < x is chosen by the player. The player who cannot make a move loses the game (and his life!).Peter wants to test some configurations of initial cycle sets before he actually plays with Dr. Octopus. Initially he has an empty set. In the i-th test he adds a cycle with ai vertices to the set (this is actually a multiset because it can contain two or more identical cycles). After each test, Peter wants to know that if the players begin the game with the current set of cycles, who wins? Peter is pretty good at math, but now he asks you to help.

"Igor K. very much likes a multiplayer role playing game WineAge II. Who knows, perhaps, that might be the reason for his poor performance at the university. As any person who plays the game, he is interested in equipping his hero with as good weapon and outfit as possible. One day, as he was reading the game's forum yet again, he discovered a very interesting fact. As it turns out, each weapon in the game is characterised with k different numbers: a1, ..., ak. They are called hit indicators and according to the game developers' plan they are pairwise coprime. The damage that is inflicted during a hit depends not only on the weapon's characteristics, but also on the hero's strength parameter. Thus, if the hero's strength equals n, than the inflicted damage will be calculated as the number of numbers on the segment , that aren't divisible by any hit indicator ai.Recently, having fulfilled another quest, Igor K. found a new Lostborn sword. He wants to know how much damage he will inflict upon his enemies if he uses it. Input: ['20 32 3 5'] Output:['6']",3
"After the most stunning success with the fifth-graders, Madoka has been trusted with teaching the sixth-graders.There's n single-place desks in her classroom. At the very beginning Madoka decided that the student number b_i (1 <= b_i <= n) will sit at the desk number i. Also there's an infinite line of students with numbers n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, ... waiting at the door with the hope of being able to learn something from the Madoka herself. Pay attention that each student has his unique number.After each lesson, the following happens in sequence.   The student sitting at the desk i moves to the desk p_i. All students move simultaneously.  If there is more than one student at a desk, the student with the lowest number keeps the place, and the others are removed from the class forever.  For all empty desks in ascending order, the student from the lowest number from the outside line occupies the desk. Note that in the end there is exactly one student at each desk again. It is guaranteed that the numbers p are such that at least one student is removed after each lesson. Check out the explanation to the first example for a better understanding.After several (possibly, zero) lessons the desk i is occupied by student a_i. Given the values a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, find the lexicographically smallest suitable initial seating permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n.The permutation is an array of n different integers from 1 up to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not (2 occurs twice). [1,3,4] is not a permutation either (n=3 but there's 4 in the array).For two different permutations a and b of the same length, a is lexicographically less than b if in the first position where a and b differ, the permutation a has a smaller element than the corresponding element in b.

"Little Petya very much likes playing with little Masha. Recently he has received a game called ""Zero-One"" as a gift from his mother. Petya immediately offered Masha to play the game with him.Before the very beginning of the game several cards are lain out on a table in one line from the left to the right. Each card contains a digit: 0 or 1. Players move in turns and Masha moves first. During each move a player should remove a card from the table and shift all other cards so as to close the gap left by the removed card. For example, if before somebody's move the cards on the table formed a sequence 01010101, then after the fourth card is removed (the cards are numbered starting from 1), the sequence will look like that: 0100101. The game ends when exactly two cards are left on the table. The digits on these cards determine the number in binary notation: the most significant bit is located to the left. Masha's aim is to minimize the number and Petya's aim is to maximize it.An unpleasant accident occurred before the game started. The kids spilled juice on some of the cards and the digits on the cards got blurred. Each one of the spoiled cards could have either 0 or 1 written on it. Consider all possible variants of initial arrangement of the digits (before the juice spilling).

Somewhere in a parallel Middle-earth, when Saruman caught Frodo, he only found n rings. And the i-th ring was either gold or silver. For convenience Saruman wrote down a binary string s of n characters, where the i-th character was 0 if the i-th ring was gold, and 1 if it was silver.Saruman has a magic function f, which takes a binary string and returns a number obtained by converting the string into a binary number and then converting the binary number into a decimal number.

The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point (x1, y1), and the distress signal came from the point (x2, y2).Due to Gadget's engineering talent, the rescuers' dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed. The only limitation is: the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed  meters per second.Of course, Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible. The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible. According to the weather forecast, the wind will be defined by the vector (vx, vy) for the nearest t seconds, and then will change to (wx, wy). These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind. Formally, if a dirigible is located at the point (x, y), while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind (ux, uy) is blowing, then after  seconds the new position of the dirigible will be .Gadget is busy piloting the aircraft, so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally.

This order deals 5 + 8 + 2 \cdot 1 = 15 damage;  second, first, third. This order deals 1 + 2 \cdot 5 + 8 = 19 damage;  second, third, first. This order deals 1 + 2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 5 = 27 damage;  third, first, second. This order deals 8 + 2 \cdot 5 + 1 = 19 damage;  third, second, first. This order deals 8 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 5 = 20 damage. Initially, Polycarp knows 0 spells. His spell set changes n times, each time he either learns a new spell or forgets an already known one. After each change, calculate the maximum possible damage Polycarp may deal using the spells he knows.

Every cell, except (n,m), has a direction R (Right) or D (Down) assigned to it. If the cell (i,j) is assigned direction R, any luggage kept on that will move to the cell (i,j+1). Similarly, if the cell (i,j) is assigned direction D, any luggage kept on that will move to the cell (i+1,j). If at any moment, the luggage moves out of the grid, it is considered to be lost.

There are N mad snakes on the site, the i'th mad snake is located on square (X_i, Y_i) and has a danger level B_i.Mr. Chanek is going to use the Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan that he learned from Lord Seventh to complete this mission. His attack strategy is as follows:  Mr. Chanek is going to make M clones.  Each clone will choose a mad snake as the attack target. Each clone must pick a different mad snake to attack.  All clones jump off the hills and attack their respective chosen target at once with Rasengan of radius R. If the mad snake at square (X, Y) is attacked with a direct Rasengan, it and all mad snakes at squares (X', Y') where max(|X' - X|, |Y' - Y|) <= R will die.  The real Mr. Chanek will calculate the score of this attack. The score is defined as the square of the sum of the danger levels of all the killed snakes.

Notice that you need to calculate the answer for all positive integers n \in [1,k] in this version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.Cirno is playing a war simulator game with n towers (numbered from 1 to n) and n bots (numbered from 1 to n). The i-th tower is initially occupied by the i-th bot for 1 <= i <= n.Before the game, Cirno first chooses a permutation p = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_n] of length n (A permutation of length n is an array of length n where each integer between 1 and n appears exactly once). After that, she can choose a sequence a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] (1 <= a_i <= n and a_i!=i for all 1 <= i <= n).The game has n rounds of attacks. In the i-th round, if the p_i-th bot is still in the game, it will begin its attack, and as the result the a_{p_i}-th tower becomes occupied by the p_i-th bot; the bot that previously occupied the a_{p_i}-th tower will no longer occupy it. If the p_i-th bot is not in the game, nothing will happen in this round.After each round, if a bot doesn't occupy any towers, it will be eliminated and leave the game. Please note that no tower can be occupied by more than one bot, but one bot can occupy more than one tower during the game.At the end of the game, Cirno will record the result as a sequence b = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n], where b_i is the number of the bot that occupies the i-th tower at the end of the game.However, as a mathematics master, she wants you to solve the following counting problem instead of playing games:Count the number of different pairs of sequences a, b from all possible choices of sequence a and permutation p.Calculate the answers for all n such that 1 <= n <= k.

There are also extra weights W_0 = W_n = 0.The instruction defines subsegment [L, R] as good if W_{L - 1} < W_i and W_R < W_i for any i in \{L, L + 1, ..., R - 1\}. For such subsegment it also defines W_M as minimum of set \{W_L, W_{L + 1}, ..., W_{R - 1}\}. Now the fun begins. In one move, the player can choose one of the good subsegments, cut it into [L, M] and [M + 1, R] and swap the two parts. More precisely, before one move the chosen subsegment of our toy looks like: W_{L - 1}, P_L, W_L, ..., W_{M - 1}, P_M, W_M, P_{M + 1}, W_{M + 1}, ..., W_{R - 1}, P_R, W_R and afterwards it looks like this: W_{L - 1}, P_{M + 1}, W_{M + 1}, ..., W_{R - 1}, P_R, W_M, P_L, W_L, ..., W_{M - 1}, P_M, W_R Such a move can be performed multiple times (possibly zero), and the goal is to achieve the minimum number of inversions in P.

"An arithmetic progression is such a non-empty sequence of numbers where the difference between any two successive numbers is constant. This constant number is called common difference. For example, the sequence 3, 7, 11, 15 is an arithmetic progression. The definition implies that any sequences whose length equals 1 or 2 are arithmetic and all sequences whose length equals 0 are non-arithmetic.You are given a sequence of different integers a1, a2, ..., an. You should either split it into two arithmetic progressions or find out that the operation is impossible to perform. Splitting assigns each member of the given sequence to one of two progressions, but the relative order of numbers does not change. Splitting is an inverse operation to merging.

A quarter labeled with letter 'A' produces q units of noise. A quarter labeled with letter 'B' produces 2·q units of noise. And so on, up to a quarter labeled with letter 'Z', which produces 26·q units of noise. There can be any number of quarters labeled with each letter in the city.When propagating from the source of the noise, the noise level is halved when moving from one quarter to a quarter that shares a side with it (when an odd number is to be halved, it's rounded down). The noise spreads along the chain. For example, if some quarter is located at a distance 2 from the noise source, then the value of noise which will reach the quarter is divided by 4.

There is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.Having a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait.

"You are playing yet another game where you kill monsters using magic spells. There are n cells in the row, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, the i-th cell contains the i-th monster with h_i health.You have a basic spell that costs 1 MP and deals 1 damage to the monster you choose. You can cast it any number of times. Also, you have a special scroll with ""Explosion"" spell you can use only once. You want to finish killing monsters with explosion, that's why you, firstly, cast the basic spell several times (possibly, zero), and then after that, you cast one ""Explosion"".How does ""Explosion"" spell work? Firstly, you choose the power of the spell: if you pour x MP into it, ""Explosion"" will deal x damage. Secondly, you choose some monster i, which will be targeted by the spell. That's what happens next:   if its current health h_i > x, then he stays alive with health decreased by x;  if h_i <= x, the i-th monster dies with an explosion that deals h_i - 1 damage to monsters in the neighboring cells i - 1 and i + 1, if these cells exist and monsters inside are still alive;  if the damage dealt by the explosion is enough to kill the monster i - 1 (or i + 1), i. e. the current h_{i - 1} <= h_i - 1 (or h_{i + 1} <= h_i - 1), then that monster also dies creating a secondary explosion of power h_{i-1} - 1 (or h_{i+1} - 1) that may deals damage to their neighbors, and so on, until the explosions end. Your goal is to kill all the remaining monsters with those ""chaining"" explosions, that's why you need a basic spell to decrease h_i of some monsters or even kill them beforehand (monsters die when their current health h_i becomes less or equal to zero). Note that monsters don't move between cells, so, for example, monsters i and i + 2 will never become neighbors.What is the minimum total MP you need to kill all monsters in the way you want? The total MP is counted as the sum of the number of basic spells you cast and the power x of explosion scroll you've chosen.

"Did you think there was going to be a JoJo legend here? But no, that was me, Dio!Given a binary string s of length n, consisting of characters 0 and 1. Let's build a square table of size n * n, consisting of 0 and 1 characters as follows.In the first row of the table write the original string s. In the second row of the table write cyclic shift of the string s by one to the right. In the third row of the table, write the cyclic shift of line s by two to the right. And so on. Thus, the row with number k will contain a cyclic shift of string s by k to the right.

"In modern cryptography much is tied to the algorithmic complexity of solving several problems. One of such problems is a discrete logarithm problem. It is formulated as follows:  Let's fix a finite field and two it's elements a and b. One need to fun such x that a^x = b or detect there is no such x. It is most likely that modern mankind cannot solve the problem of discrete logarithm for a sufficiently large field size. For example, for a field of residues modulo prime number, primes of 1024 or 2048 bits are considered to be safe. However, calculations with such large numbers can place a significant load on servers that perform cryptographic operations. For this reason, instead of a simple module residue field, more complex fields are often used. For such field no fast algorithms that use a field structure are known, smaller fields can be used and operations can be properly optimized. Developer Nikolai does not trust the generally accepted methods, so he wants to invent his own. Recently, he read about a very strange field — nimbers, and thinks it's a great fit for the purpose. The field of nimbers is defined on a set of integers from 0 to 2^{2^k} - 1 for some positive integer k . Bitwise exclusive or (\oplus) operation is used as addition. One of ways to define multiplication operation (\odot) is following properties:   0 \odot a = a \odot 0 = 0  1 \odot a = a \odot 1 = a  a \odot b = b \odot a  a \odot (b \odot c)= (a \odot b) \odot c  a \odot (b \oplus c) = (a \odot b) \oplus (a \odot c)  If a = 2^{2^n} for some integer n > 0, and b < a, then a \odot b = a \cdot b.  If a = 2^{2^n} for some integer n > 0, then a \odot a = \frac{3}{2}\cdot a. For example:    4 \odot 4 = 6   8 \odot 8 = 4 \odot 2 \odot 4 \odot 2 = 4 \odot 4 \odot 2 \odot 2 = 6 \odot 3 = (4 \oplus 2) \odot 3 = (4 \odot 3) \oplus (2 \odot (2 \oplus 1)) = (4 \odot 3) \oplus (2 \odot 2) \oplus (2 \odot 1) = 12 \oplus 3 \oplus 2 = 13.  32 \odot 64 = (16 \odot 2) \odot (16 \odot 4) = (16 \odot 16) \odot (2 \odot 4) = 24 \odot 8 = (16 \oplus 8) \odot 8 = (16 \odot 8) \oplus (8 \odot 8) = 128 \oplus 13 = 141  5 \odot 6 = (4 \oplus 1) \odot (4 \oplus 2) = (4\odot 4) \oplus (4 \odot 2) \oplus (4 \odot 1) \oplus (1 \odot 2) = 6 \oplus 8 \oplus 4 \oplus 2 = 8 Formally, this algorithm can be described by following pseudo-code. multiply(a, b) {   ans = 0   for p1 in bits(a)       // numbers of bits of a equal to one       for p2 in bits(b)   // numbers of bits of b equal to one          ans = ans xor multiply_powers_of_2(1 << p1, 1 << p2)   return ans;}multiply_powers_of_2(a, b) {    if (a == 1 or b == 1) return a * b    n = maximal value, such 2^{2^{n}} <= max(a, b)    power = 2^{2^{n}};    if (a >= power and b >= power) {        return multiply(power * 3 / 2, multiply_powers_of_2(a / power, b / power))    } else if (a >= power) {        return multiply_powers_of_2(a / power, b) * power    } else {        return multiply_powers_of_2(a, b / power) * power    }}It can be shown, that this operations really forms a field. Moreover, than can make sense as game theory operations, but that's not related to problem much. With the help of appropriate caching and grouping of operations, it is possible to calculate the product quickly enough, which is important to improve speed of the cryptoalgorithm. More formal definitions as well as additional properties can be clarified in the wikipedia article at link. The authors of the task hope that the properties listed in the statement should be enough for the solution. Powering for such muliplication is defined in same way, formally a^{\odot k} = \underbrace{a \odot a \odot \cdots \odot a}_{k~\texttt{times}}.You need to analyze the proposed scheme strength. For pairs of numbers a and b you need to find such x, that a^{\odot x} = b, or determine that it doesn't exist.

"While James is gone on business, Vesper takes her time and explores what the legendary Casino Royale has to offer to people who are fond of competitive programming.Her attention was grabbed by the very new ""Pull Your Luck"" roulette which functions in a pretty peculiar way. The roulette's wheel consists of n sectors number from 0 to n - 1. There is no ball and the winning sector is determined by a static arrow pointing to one of the sectors. Sectors' indexes go in the natural order and the wheel always spins in the direction of indexes increment. That means that sector i + 1 goes right after sector i for all i from 0 to n - 2, and sector 0 goes right after sector n - 1.After a bet is made, the player is allowed to pull the triggering handle herself and cause the wheel to spin. If the player's initial pull is made with the force equal to positive integer f, the wheel will spin for f seconds. During the first second it will advance f sectors, the next second it will advance f - 1 sectors, then f - 2 sectors, and so on until it comes to a complete stop. After the wheel comes to a complete stop, the sector which the arrow is pointing to is the winning one.The roulette's arrow currently points at sector x. Vesper knows that she can pull the handle with any integer force from 1 to p inclusive. Note that it is not allowed to pull the handle with force 0, i. e. not pull it all. The biggest prize is awarded if the winning sector is 0. Now Vesper wonders if she can make sector 0 win by pulling the triggering handle exactly once?

"Easy and hard versions are actually different problems, so we advise you to read both statements carefully.You are given a weighted rooted tree, vertex 1 is the root of this tree. Also, each edge has its own cost.A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. A parent of a vertex v is the last different from v vertex on the path from the root to the vertex v. Children of vertex v are all vertices for which v is the parent. A vertex is a leaf if it has no children. The weighted tree is such a tree that each edge of this tree has some weight.The weight of the path is the sum of edges weights on this path. The weight of the path from the vertex to itself is 0.You can make a sequence of zero or more moves. On each move, you select an edge and divide its weight by 2 rounding down. More formally, during one move, you choose some edge i and divide its weight by 2 rounding down (w_i := <=ft\lfloor\frac{w_i}{2}\right\rfloor).Each edge i has an associated cost c_i which is either 1 or 2 coins. Each move with edge i costs c_i coins.Your task is to find the minimum total cost to make the sum of weights of paths from the root to each leaf at most S. In other words, if w(i, j) is the weight of the path from the vertex i to the vertex j, then you have to make \sum\limits_{v \in leaves} w(root, v) <= S, where leaves is the list of all leaves.You have to answer t independent test cases.

Right now, the duck is at the cell (1, 1) (the cell in the top left corner) and would like to reach the cell (n, n) (the cell in the bottom right corner) by moving either down 1 cell or to the right 1 cell each second.Since Omkar thinks ducks are fun, he wants to play a game with you based on the movement of the duck. First, for each cell (x, y) in the grid, you will tell Omkar a nonnegative integer a_{x,y} not exceeding 10^{16}, and Omkar will then put a_{x,y} uninteresting problems in the cell (x, y). After that, the duck will start their journey from (1, 1) to (n, n). For each cell (x, y) that the duck crosses during their journey (including the cells (1, 1) and (n, n)), the duck will eat the a_{x,y} uninteresting problems in that cell. Once the duck has completed their journey, Omkar will measure their mass to determine the total number k of uninteresting problems that the duck ate on their journey, and then tell you k.Your challenge, given k, is to exactly reproduce the duck's path, i. e. to tell Omkar precisely which cells the duck crossed on their journey.

"As you know, Hogwarts has four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. The sorting of the first-years into houses is done by the Sorting Hat. The pupils are called one by one in the alphabetical order, each of them should put a hat on his head and, after some thought, the hat solemnly announces the name of the house the student should enter.At that the Hat is believed to base its considerations on the student's personal qualities: it sends the brave and noble ones to Gryffindor, the smart and shrewd ones — to Ravenclaw, the persistent and honest ones — to Hufflepuff and the clever and cunning ones — to Slytherin. However, a first year student Hermione Granger got very concerned about the forthcoming sorting. She studied all the literature on the Sorting Hat and came to the conclusion that it is much simpler than that. If the relatives of the student have already studied at Hogwarts, the hat puts the student to the same house, where his family used to study. In controversial situations, when the relatives studied in different houses or when they were all Muggles like Hermione's parents, then the Hat sorts the student to the house, to which the least number of first years has been sent at that moment. If there are several such houses, the choice is given to the student himself. Then the student can choose any of the houses, to which the least number of first years has been sent so far. Hermione has already asked the students that are on the list before her about their relatives. Now she and her new friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley want to find out into what house the Hat will put Hermione. Input: ['11G????SS???H'] Output:['GryffindorRavenclaw']",0

The training contests are quite unusual – there are two people in a team, two problems, and each competitor will code exactly one of them. Of course, people in one team will code different problems.Rules of scoring also aren't typical. The first problem is always an implementation problem: you have to implement some well-known algorithm very fast and the time of your typing is rated. The second one is an awful geometry task and you just have to get it accepted in reasonable time. Here the length and difficulty of your code are important. After that, Zibi will give some penalty points (possibly negative) for each solution and the final score of the team is the sum of them (the less the score is, the better).We know that the i-th competitor will always have score x_i when he codes the first task and y_i when he codes the second task.

"The only difference from the previous problem is the constraint on the number of requests. In this problem your program should guess the answer doing at most 7 requests.This problem is a little bit unusual. Here you are to implement an interaction with a testing system. That means that you can make queries and get responses in the online mode. Please be sure to use the stream flushing operation after each query's output in order not to leave part of your output in some buffer. For example, in C++ you've got to use the fflush(stdout) function, in Java — call System.out.flush(), and in Pascal — flush(output).Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls or Bulls and Cleots) is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind.On a sheet of paper, the first player thinks a secret string. This string consists only of digits and has the length 4. The digits in the string must be all different, no two or more equal digits are allowed.Then the second player tries to guess his opponent's string. For every guess the first player gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are ""bulls"", if on different positions, they are ""cows"". Thus a response is a pair of numbers — the number of ""bulls"" and the number of ""cows"". A try can contain equal digits.More formally, let's the secret string is s and the second player are trying to guess it with a string x. The number of ""bulls"" is a number of such positions i (1 ≤ i ≤ 4) where s[i] = x[i]. The number of ""cows"" is a number of such digits c that s contains c in the position i (i.e. s[i] = c), x contains c, but x[i] ≠ c.For example, the secret string is ""0427"", the opponent's try is ""0724"", then the answer is 2 bulls and 2 cows (the bulls are ""0"" and ""2"", the cows are ""4"" and ""7""). If the secret string is ""0123"", the opponent's try is ""0330"", then the answer is 1 bull and 1 cow.In this problem you are to guess the string s that the system has chosen. You only know that the chosen string consists of 4 distinct digits.You can make queries to the testing system, each query is the output of a single 4-digit string. The answer to the query is the number of bulls and number of cows. If the system's response equals ""4 0"", that means the interaction with your problem is over and the program must terminate. That is possible for two reasons — the program either guessed the number x or made an invalid action (for example, printed letters instead of digits).Your program is allowed to do at most 7 queries.You can hack solutions of other participants providing a 4-digit string containing distinct digits — the secret string.

Based on election results k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) top candidates will take seats in the parliament.After the end of the voting the number of votes for each candidate is calculated. In the resulting table the candidates are ordered by the number of votes. In case of tie (equal number of votes) they are ordered by the time of the last vote given. The candidate with ealier last vote stands higher in the resulting table.So in the resulting table candidates are sorted by the number of votes (more votes stand for the higher place) and if two candidates have equal number of votes they are sorted by the time of last vote (earlier last vote stands for the higher place).There is no way for a candidate with zero votes to take a seat in the parliament.

Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.

Two ways are considered different if they differ as sets of visited positions. Input: ['8 1', ''] Output:['1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 ']",0
"Vasya is a regular participant at programming contests and is already experienced in finding important sentences in long statements. Of course, numbers constraints are important — factorization of a number less than 1000000 is easier than of a number less than 1000000000. However, sometimes it's hard to understand the number at the first glance. Could it be shortened? For example, instead of 1000000 you could write 10^{6}, instead of 1000000000  —10^{9}, instead of 1000000007 — 10^{9}+7.Vasya decided that, to be concise, the notation should follow several rules:   the notation should only consist of numbers, operations of addition (""+""), multiplication (""*"") and exponentiation (""^""), in particular, the use of braces is forbidden;  the use of several exponentiation operations in a row is forbidden, for example, writing ""2^3^4"" is unacceptable;  the value of the resulting expression equals to the initial number;  the notation should consist of the minimal amount of symbols. Given n, find the equivalent concise notation for it. Input: ['2018'] Output:['2018']",0

"You are responsible for installing a gas pipeline along a road. Let's consider the road (for simplicity) as a segment [0, n] on OX axis. The road can have several crossroads, but for simplicity, we'll denote each crossroad as an interval (x, x + 1) with integer x. So we can represent the road as a binary string consisting of n characters, where character 0 means that current interval doesn't contain a crossroad, and 1 means that there is a crossroad.Usually, we can install the pipeline along the road on height of 1 unit with supporting pillars in each integer point (so, if we are responsible for [0, n] road, we must install n + 1 pillars). But on crossroads we should lift the pipeline up to the height 2, so the pipeline won't obstruct the way for cars.We can do so inserting several zig-zag-like lines. Each zig-zag can be represented as a segment [x, x + 1] with integer x consisting of three parts: 0.5 units of horizontal pipe + 1 unit of vertical pipe + 0.5 of horizontal. Note that if pipeline is currently on height 2, the pillars that support it should also have length equal to 2 units.  Each unit of gas pipeline costs us a bourles, and each unit of pillar — b bourles. So, it's not always optimal to make the whole pipeline on the height 2. Find the shape of the pipeline with minimum possible cost and calculate that cost.Note that you must start and finish the pipeline on height 1 and, also, it's guaranteed that the first and last characters of the input string are equal to 0.

Let's define the luckiness of a number x as the difference between the largest and smallest digits of that number. For example, 142857 has 8 as its largest digit and 1 as its smallest digit, so its luckiness is 8-1=7. And the number 111 has all digits equal to 1, so its luckiness is zero.Hateehc is a famous Martian blogger who often flies to different corners of the solar system.

"A conglomerate consists of n companies. To make managing easier, their owners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only possible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies, merge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company left.But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect unfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum salaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum salaries are equal.To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can change salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists on two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the employees in one company must get the same increase.Sure enough, the owners want to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies.

"Vova has recently learned what a circulaton in a graph is. Recall the definition: let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. A circulation f is such a collection of non-negative real numbers f_e (e \in E), that for each vertex v \in V the following conservation condition holds:\sum\limits_{e \in \delta^{-}(v)} f_e = \sum\limits_{e \in \delta^{+}(v)} f_ewhere \delta^{+}(v) is the set of edges that end in the vertex v, and \delta^{-}(v) is the set of edges that start in the vertex v. In other words, for each vertex the total incoming flow should be equal to the total outcoming flow.Let a lr-circulation be such a circulation f that for each edge the condition l_e <=q f_e <=q r_e holds, where l_e and r_e for each edge e \in E are two non-negative real numbers denoting the lower and upper bounds on the value of the circulation on this edge e.Vova can't stop thinking about applications of a new topic. Right now he thinks about the following natural question: let the graph be fixed, and each value l_e and r_e be a linear function of a real variable t:l_e(t) = a_e t + b_e r_e(t) = c_e t + d_eNote that t is the same for all edges.Let t be chosen at random from uniform distribution on a segment [0, 1].

The shop can make the refrigerator with any size of the door that meets the following restrictions: the refrigerator door must be rectangle, and both the length and the width of the door must be positive integers.Edo figured out how he wants to place the magnets on the refrigerator. He introduced a system of coordinates on the plane, where each magnet is represented as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.Now he wants to remove no more than k magnets (he may choose to keep all of them) and attach all remaining magnets to the refrigerator door, and the area of ​​the door should be as small as possible. A magnet is considered to be attached to the refrigerator door if its center lies on the door or on its boundary. The relative positions of all the remaining magnets must correspond to the plan.Let us explain the last two sentences. Let's suppose we want to hang two magnets on the refrigerator. If the magnet in the plan has coordinates of the lower left corner (x1, y1) and the upper right corner (x2, y2), then its center is located at (, ) (may not be integers).

"Integer factorisation is hard. The RSA Factoring Challenge offered 100\,000 for factoring RSA-1024, a 1024-bit long product of two prime numbers. To this date, nobody was able to claim the prize. We want you to factorise a 1024-bit number.Since your programming language of choice might not offer facilities for handling large integers, we will provide you with a very simple calculator. To use this calculator, you can print queries on the standard output and retrieve the results from the standard input. The operations are as follows:   + x y where x and y are integers between 0 and n-1. Returns (x+y) \bmod n.  - x y where x and y are integers between 0 and n-1. Returns (x-y) \bmod n.  * x y where x and y are integers between 0 and n-1. Returns (x \cdot y) \bmod n.  / x y where x and y are integers between 0 and n-1 and y is coprime with n. Returns (x \cdot y^{-1}) \bmod n where y^{-1} is multiplicative inverse of y modulo n. If y is not coprime with n, then -1 is returned instead.  sqrt x where x is integer between 0 and n-1 coprime with n. Returns y such that y^2 \bmod n = x. If there are multiple such integers, only one of them is returned. If there are none, -1 is returned instead.  ^ x y where x and y are integers between 0 and n-1. Returns {x^y \bmod n}.

Initially, vertex 1 is the root of the tree.Alisa and Yuki are growing the tree not just for fun, they want to sell it. The cost of the tree is defined as the maximum distance from the root to a vertex among all vertices of the tree.

"You are given an m x n grid grid where:
'.' is an empty cell.
'#' is a wall.
'@' is the starting point.
Lowercase letters represent keys.
Uppercase letters represent locks.
You start at the starting point and one move consists of walking one space in one of the four cardinal directions. You cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.
If you walk over a key, you can pick it up and you cannot walk over a lock unless you have its corresponding key.
For some 1 <= k <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first k letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.
Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it is impossible, return -1.

"Polycarp is practicing his problem solving skill. He has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly k days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all n problems in exactly k days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in k days he will solve all the n problems.The profit of the j-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the j-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from l to r during a day, then the profit of the day is \max\limits_{l <= i <= r}a_i). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all k days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all n problems between k days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if n = 8, k = 3 and a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: [5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2].

You are given a directed acyclic graph with n vertices and m edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges between any pair of vertices. Graph can be disconnected.You should assign labels to all vertices in such a way that:  Labels form a valid permutation of length n — an integer sequence such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.  If there exists an edge from vertex v to vertex u then labelv should be smaller than labelu.  Permutation should be lexicographically smallest among all suitable.

"You are given a bipartite graph with n_1 vertices in the first part, n_2 vertices in the second part, and m edges. The maximum matching in this graph is the maximum possible (by size) subset of edges of this graph such that no vertex is incident to more than one chosen edge.You have to process two types of queries to this graph:  1 — remove the minimum possible number of vertices from this graph so that the size of the maximum matching gets reduced exactly by 1, and print the vertices that you have removed. Then, find any maximum matching in this graph and print the sum of indices of edges belonging to this matching;  2 — query of this type will be asked only after a query of type 1. As the answer to this query, you have to print the edges forming the maximum matching you have chosen in the previous query. Note that you should solve the problem in online mode.

Therefore, it cannot determine their gender. Dasha can't do it either. The only one who can help is a doctor. To keep guinea pigs, aviaries are needed. Dasha plans to buy them in the same store.
