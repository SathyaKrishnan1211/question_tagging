## STACKING OF HYPERPARAMETER TUNED MODELS FOR TAGGING CODING PROBLEMS

Abstract â€“ Coding problems are problems that require a solution in the form of a computer program. Coding problems are popular among students and professionals as it enhances their skills and career opportunities. An AI system that would help those who practice coding problems would be highly useful and there is a huge potential for such a system. In this work, we propose a model which uses stacking of hyperparameter tuned boosting models to achieve impressive metric scores of **77.8% accuracy** and **0.815 PR-AUC** on the dataset that was scraped from Codeforces and Leetcode. We open source the dataset and the models developed for this work.<br><br>
