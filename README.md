# PowerCoder: QuestionTagging

Question classification or question tagging is the process of identifying to which category a question belongs to. The research work this area has 
so far focussed on more general categories but not on specific sub-categories. In the paper, we propose a Random Forest algorithm based classifier 
that has been used to classify coding questions or questions that have to be answered using a high level program based on the data structures that 
can be used to solve the question. The purpose of identifying the appropriate data structure is that, it can be used to generate algorithms and 
high level programs that can be used to solve the question. The questions in the data belong to ‘array’, ‘graph’ and ‘string’. Only three classes 
have been used because of the lack of a balanced dataset. Most of the standard machine learning classification algorithms have been used out of 
which Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms performed the best. Since, Gradient Boosting took a longer time to train, Random Forest has 
been used as the final model in this paper. It achieved an accuracy of 78.77% in the test set without much hyper-parameter tuning. 
Future works will focus on including more classes and the development of deep learning based architectures for the problem at hand.
